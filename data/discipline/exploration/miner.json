    "description": "Extracting minerals from the depths of the earth is the type of work that requires strength, endurance, stamina, and a lot of persistence. Contrary to popular belief, it is hard work rather than luck that springs forth the bounty of minerals from the earth. Armed with a trusty pick and plenty of bag room, the miner is prepared for a great haul but also understands that sometimes you have to go deeper.",
