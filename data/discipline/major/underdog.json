    "description": "It has been said repeatedly throughout time that the outcome of a match can rarely be predicted. No matter how many times an underdog gets knocked down they are determined to get back up and back into the fray. Remember, itâ€™s not the size of the dog in the fight!",
    "lore": "Step with care and great tact, and remember that life is a great balancing act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right hook with your left."
